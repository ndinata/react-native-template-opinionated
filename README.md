# react-native-template-opinionated

An opinionated template for new React Native projects in TypeScript (non-Expo).

## Usage

```sh
# Replace `MyProject` below with your project name!

# latest template version â€” needs Node >= 18
npx react-native init MyProject --template react-native-template-opinionated

# alternatively, use an older version of React Native (more info in table below)
npx react-native init MyProject --template 'react-native-template-opinionated@6.0.*'
```

#### Different Versions of React Native

## Create Native App

This project initially started out as a collection of Bash scripts, with the same
goal of automating the setup for a base React Native project. This repo was adapted
after React Native CLI added the ability to "templatise" a new project. You can check
out the project's initial form [here](https://github.com/ndinata/react-native-template-opinionated/tree/v1.0.0).
